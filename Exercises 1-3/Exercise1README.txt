Instructions:

The goal of this exercise is to ensure you have Java installed on your system, set up an IDE for writing and running Java code, and create your first Java program. You will also learn to create a GitHub repository to manage your code.

Steps:
1. Check if Java is Installed:
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Type the command:
java -version
Note the version of Java installed on your machine. If Java is not installed:
Download and install the Java Development Kit (JDK) from Oracle's official site or OpenJDK.
After installation, re-run the java -version command to confirm the installation.
2. Install an IDE:
Choose and install one of the following Integrated Development Environments (IDE):
IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition
Eclipse IDE
Visual Studio Code with the Java extension.
Configure the IDE to recognize your JDK installation.
3. Write Your First Java Program:
Open your chosen IDE.
Create a new Java project and add a file named Main.java.
Write the following code in the Main.java file:
public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.println("Hello, World!");
}
}
Run the program in your IDE.
Ensure that "Hello, World!" is displayed in the console.
