Instructions:

Steps:
Set Up Your Environment:

If you completed Exercise 2, your environment should already be set up:
Java installed on your system.
An IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code).
Your GitHub repository already created and your files uploaded.
If not, follow the instructions from Exercise 1 and Exercise 2 to ensure everything is ready before proceeding.
Add a Constructor to Your Class:

Open the Java project you created in Exercise 2.
In the Book.java (or your chosen class, like Student.java), add a constructor that allows initializing the class attributes.
Use both a no-argument constructor and a parameterized constructor to initialize objects of the class. The no-argument constructor should set default values, while the parameterized constructor should allow you to initialize objects with custom values.
For example, in Book.java, you can add the constructor like this:
Update Your Main File:

In the Main.java file, update your code to use both constructors:
Create objects using the no-argument constructor and the parameterized constructor.
Demonstrate setting values for attributes using the setters, and use getters to display values in your program.
Add the Updated Class to GitHub:

After making the necessary changes, open a terminal, navigate to your project directory, and add the updated Book.java (or Student.java, etc.) file to your GitHub repository.
