Constructors in Java:

When it comes to Java, a constructor is a special method used to initialize objects.
Fun fact, all classes have a default constructor upon creation! 
Constructors MUST match the class name, and it cannot have a return type such as void for example.
There are 3 types of constructors in Java:

- Default constructor = The constructor automatically made when the class is created, it has no parameters defined and is invisible to user
Fun fact, if we create the constructor with no parameters, the compiler will not make the invisible one as it is not needed
Ex: public Car () {
	name = "Ex: Ford";
}
- Parameterized constructor = This is a constructor made by the program creator with specified parameters/arguments for the constructor
You can have 1 argument or many more, all depends on what is desired
Ex: public Car (String n) {
	name = n;
}
- Copy constructor = This constructor is created when another object is created when the data is copied from the passed object to the new object
Ex: public Car (String n) {
	name = n;
}

Car(Car car2)
{
  n = car2.name;
}
